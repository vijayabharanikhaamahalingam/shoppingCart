# React Shopping cart

Create a shopping cart using React that allows users to add and remove items from the cart.
The shopping cart should be based on the design of the following link:

Requirements:
1. The shopping cart should display a list of available products with their name and
description.
2. Users should be able to add items to the cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
3. When an item is added to the cart, the cart quantity number should be increased.
4. The "Add to Cart" button should be changed to the "Remove from Cart" button once the
item is added to the cart.
5. Users should be able to remove items from the cart by clicking the "Remove from Cart"
button.
6. When an item is removed from the cart, the cart quantity number should be decreased.
7. The "Remove from Cart" button should be changed back to the "Add to Cart" button
once the item is removed from the cart.
Deliverables:
1. A working React application that meets the above requirements.
2. The application should be well-documented, including code comments and a README
file that describes how to run the application.
3. The code should be submitted in a Git repository, with a clear commit history that
demonstrates the development process.
